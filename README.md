# V^2FS Queries

This repo contains the queries we have used in the experiments of our system. The queries are from Awesome BigQuery Views <https://github.com/blockchain-etl/awesome-bigquery-views>. We select the queries for Bitcoin and (or) Ethereum, then translate them from SQL to SQLite for our experiments.
